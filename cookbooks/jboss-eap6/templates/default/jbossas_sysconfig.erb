# Service-specific configuration file for jbossas services
# This will be sourced by the SysV service script after the global
# configuration file /etc/jbossas/jbossas.conf, thus allowing values
# to be overridden on a per-service way
#
# NEVER change the init script itself:
# To change values for all services make your changes in
# /etc/jbossas/jbossas.conf
# To change values for a specific service, change it here
# To create a new service, create a link from /etc/init.d/<you new service> to
# /etc/init.d/jbossas (do not copy the init script) and make a copy of the
# /etc/sysconfig/jbossas file to /etc/sysconfig/<you new service> and change
# the property values so the two services won't conflict
# Register the new service in the system as usual (see chkconfig and similars)
#
# To change a setting, uncomment the line and set the value for what you want
# The values in the comments are the default values, shown here for convenience
#
