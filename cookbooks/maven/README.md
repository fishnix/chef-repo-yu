Description
===========

Install and configure maven2 and maven3 from the binaries provided by
the maven project

Provides the `maven` LWRP for pulling a maven artifact from a maven
repository and placing it in an arbitrary location.


Requirements
============

Platform:

* Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat, Fedora

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* java - this cookbook not only depends on the java virtual machine
  but it also depends on the java_ark LWRP present in the java cookbooks
* ark - used to unpack the maven tarball

Attributes
==========

* default['maven']['version']  defaults to 2
* default['maven']['m2_home']  defaults to  '/usr/local/maven/'
* default['maven']['m2_download_url']  the download url for maven2
* default['maven']['m2_checksum']  the checksum, which you will have
 to recalculate if you change the download url
* default['maven']['m3_download_url'] download url for maven3
* default['maven']['m3_checksum'] the checksum, which you will have
 to recalculate if you change the download url
* default['maven']['setup_bin'] Whether or not to put mvn on your
 system path, defaults to false


Usage
=====

Simply include the recipe where you want Apache Maven installed.

The maven lwrp has two actions, `:install` and `:put`. They are
essentially the same accept that the install action will name the the
downloaded file `artifact_id-version.packaging`. For example, the
mysql jar would be named mysql-5.1.19.jar.

Use the put action when you want to explicitly control the name of the
downloaded file. This is useful when you download an artifact and then
want to have Chef resources act on files within that the artifact. The
put action will creat a file named `name.packaging` where name
corresponds to the name attribute.


Providers/Resources
===================

maven
-----

* artifact_id: if this is not specified, the resource's name is used
* group_id: group_id for the artifact
* version: version of the artifact
* dest: the destination folder for the jar and its dependencies
* packaging: defaults to 'jar'
* classifier: distinguishes artifacts that were built from the same POM but differ in context
* repositories: array of maven repositories to use, defaults to
 ["http://repo1.maven.apache.org/maven2"]
* owner: the owner of the resulting file, default is root
* mode: integer value for file permissions, default is 0644
* transitive: whether to resolve dependencies transitively, defaults to false. Please note: Event true will only place one artifact in dest. All others are downloaded to the local repository.

# Examples

    maven "mysql-connector-java" do
      group_id "mysql"
      version "5.1.19"
      dest "/usr/local/tomcat/lib/"
    end
    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.19.jar

    maven "solr" do
      group_id "org.apache.solr"
      version "3.6.1"
      packaging "war"
      dest "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/"
      action :put
    end
    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/solr.war

    maven "custom-application" do
      group_id "com.company.name"
      version "2.0.0"
      dest "/usr/local/tomcat/lib"
      classifier "client"
      action :put
    end
    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/lib/custom-application-2.0.0-client.jar
