They are\nessentially the same accept that the install action will name the the\ndownloaded file `artifact_id-version.packaging`. For example, the\nmysql jar would be named mysql-5.1.19.jar.\n\nUse the put action when you want to explicitly control the name of the\ndownloaded file. This is useful when you download an artifact and then\nwant to have Chef resources act on files within that the artifact. The\nput action will creat a file named `name.packaging` where name\ncorresponds to the name attribute.\n\n\nProviders/Resources\n===================\n\nmaven\n-----\n\n* artifact_id: if this is not specified, the resource's name is used\n* group_id: group_id for the artifact\n* version: version of the artifact\n* dest: the destination folder for the jar and its dependencies\n* packaging: defaults to 'jar'\n* classifier: distinguishes artifacts that were built from the same POM but differ in context\n* repositories: array of maven repositories to use, defaults to\n [\"http://repo1.maven.apache.org/maven2\"]\n* owner: the owner of the resulting file, default is root\n* mode: integer value for file permissions, default is 0644\n* transitive: whether to resolve dependencies transitively, defaults to false. Please note: Event true will only place one artifact in dest. All others are downloaded to the local repository.\n\n# Examples\n\n    maven \"mysql-connector-java\" do\n      group_id \"mysql\"\n      version \"5.1.19\"\n      dest \"/usr/local/tomcat/lib/\"\n    end\n    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.19.jar\n\n    maven \"solr\" do\n      group_id \"org.apache.solr\"\n      version \"3.6.1\"\n      packaging \"war\"\n      dest \"/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/\"\n      action :put\n    end\n    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/solr.war\n\n    maven \"custom-application\" do\n      group_id \"com.company.name\"\n      version \"2.0.0\"\n      dest \"/usr/local/tomcat/lib\"\n      classifier \"client\"\n      action :put\n    end\n    # The artifact will be downloaded to /usr/local/tomcat/lib/custom-application-2.0.0-client.jar\n\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@opscode.com>)\nAuthor:: Bryan W.
